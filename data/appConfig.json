		"<h3>About this Map</h3>",
		"<p>The subtitle is borrowed from historian Robin D.G. Kelley, who begins one of his essays with the question \"What is the United States, if not a nation of overlapping diasporas?\" At all points in its history, a significant proportion of the population of the United States had been born in other countries and regions. This being the case, American history can never be understood by just looking within its borders. The culture and politics of the US have always been profoundly shaped by the material and emotional ties many of its residents have had to the places where they were born. This map will allow you to begin to explore those connections at the basic level of demographic statistics. </p>",
		"<h3>Sources</h3>",
		"<p>All of the data comes from <a href='https://www.nhgis.org/'>Minnesota Population Center, National Historical Geographic Information System: Version 2.0 (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota, 2011)</a>. County boundaries are from the Newberry Library's <a href='http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/'>Atlas of Historical County Boundaries</a>.</p>",
		"<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>",
		"<p>Much of the best scholarship on the foreign born concentrates on particular groups at specific moments in time, works like George J. Sanchez's <cite>Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity, Culture and Identity in Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945</cite>. Some thoughtful works that deal with the foreign-born population and issues of migration more generally are:</p>",
